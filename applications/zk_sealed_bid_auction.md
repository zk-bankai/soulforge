## [Section 2] Project Overview :page_facing_up:

  

-  **Brief Description:**

This project is a **Sealed-Bid Auction** platform built on **zkVM**, leveraging **Plonky3** toolkit. Its main objective is to enable secure and private auctions by using **zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)** to select the winning bidder without revealing any details about individual bids. This ensures complete confidentiality for bidders while maintaining fairness in determining the highest bid.

We are excited about this project because it applies **zero-knowledge** techniques to real-world challenges, where privacy, transparency and security are crucial. This platform addresses the challenge of maintaining participant confidentiality while ensuring a fair outcome in sealed-bid auctions. The potential applications are vast, from government contracts and corporate procurement to high-value asset auctions, where secure and anonymous bidding is essential.

Beyond its practical use, this project also serves as a **reference model** for developers interested in building ZK-based decentralized applications using **Plonky3**. It demonstrates how zero-knowledge technology can enhance privacy in competitive bidding scenarios and lays a foundation for future projects in the ZK space.

-  **Core Idea:**

The primary goal of this project is to create a **Sealed-Bid Auction** platform that guarantees complete privacy and fairness in selecting the winning bidder. The innovation lies in utilizing **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to validate bids without revealing any information about the individual bids themselves. The auction logic, including processes such as bid encryption, winner computation, and proof generation, is carried out off-chain, while the bidding, verification and auction settlement occur on-chain via the smart contract.

Key components of our project include:

- **Proving Service**: Powered by **Plonky3**, this service generates a **zero-knowledge proof** from the **execution trace** of a program that decrypts the encrypted bids and computes the winner, without disclosing the bid amounts.

- **SmartContract**: This contract is responsible for verifying the ZK proof, as well as managing the entire auction lifecycle, including setup, bidding, and settlement.

This architecture ensures that bidders maintain full privacy while the smart contract verifies the proof generated by the proving service. TThe solution is designed to scale efficiently, ensuring that even with a high number of participants, the privacy of each bidder is preserved, and the auction remains **transparent** and **fair**. Beyond addressing the practical application of zero-knowledge proofs in sealed-bid auctions, this project serves as a **reference model** for developers seeking to explore **ZK-based decentralized applications using Plonky3**.
  

-  **Technology Stack:**
**SilentBid** utilizes a diverse technology stack to build a secure and efficient sealed-bid auction platform:

- Smart Contract: Solidity
- Proving Service: Rust, Plonky3.
- Layer 2 Chain: Polygon
  

-  **Design Mockups/Prototypes (Optional):**

The core logic of **SilentBid** operates on-chain, while the processes of calculating the winner and generating the proof occur off-chain. The project follows a structured flow with four main phases:

- **Initial setup**: The auction owner creates the auction, sets the required deposit amount, transfers assets to the smart contract, and defines the block time for the **Bid Phase**.
- **Bid phase**: During this phase, bidders can deposit the required amount and submit their bids to the smart contract.
- **Open phase**: Once the bid submission window closes, the auction owner calls the **proving service** to compute the winner and generate the zero-knowledge proof.
- **Verify phase**: The owner submits both the winner and the proof to the smart contract for verification, at which point the auction is settled.

**Below are the sequence diagrams of each module:**

Auction flow:

Prover & Verifier flow:

![prover_verifier_flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VanhGer/soulforge/refs/heads/vjp/prover_verifier_flow.png)


Here is the pseudo code of the proving service:

```ts
function get_winner(
    witness: {
        owner_private_key: string
    },
    public_params: {
        encrypted_bids: EncryptedBid[]
    }
): { winner: address, input_hash: string } {
    
    // Decrypt all encrypted bids using the owner's private key
    const bids: Bid[] = public_params.encrypted_bids.map(enc_bid => 
        decrypt_bid(witness.owner_private_key, enc_bid)
    );

    // Find the winning bid based on auction criteria
    const winner_bid: Bid = find_max(bids);

    // Generate a hash of the input parameters for verification purposes
    const input_hash: string = hash(public_params);

    // Return the winner's address and the input hash for verification
    return { 
        winner: winner_bid.bidder, 
        input_hash 
    };
}

// Define the Bid type
type Bid = {
    bidder: address,
    amount: number
};

```

and the smart contract:

    }

}

```
  

## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit

  
-  **Similar Projects:**

Several research papers have explored the concept of sealed-bid auctions on blockchain, including [Anonymous Fair Auction on Blockchain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9432664) and [A Blockchain-Based Sealed-Bid e-Auction Scheme with Smart Contract and Zero-Knowledge Proof](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351717293_A_Blockchain-Based_Sealed-Bid_e-Auction_Scheme_with_Smart_Contract_and_Zero-Knowledge_Proof). However, these solutions often rely on the assumption that the verifier possesses both a private and public key, which is impractical for smart contracts. Some implementations, like [AuctionContract](https://github.com/HSG88/AuctionContract), focus solely on smart contracts without providing a complete system for secure, private auctions.

Our project aims to build a comprehensive auction platform that addresses these limitations. Rather than depending on the verifier’s key pair, we use the auction owner’s private and public keys and leverage **Plonky3** to develop a robust and secure proof system. This ensures the auction process is both transparent and privacy-preserving, offering a more practical and scalable solution for decentralized sealed-bid auctions.

-  **Unique Contribution:**

This project brings significant value to the **Plonky3** ecosystem by demonstrating how its advanced **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** can be applied to practical, real-world scenarios, specifically in **Sealed-Bid Auctions**. The key gap it fills is the lack of **privacy-focused, decentralized** auction platforms that allow for both confidentiality and transparency.

By using **Plonky3**, this project showcases the potential of zero-knowledge technology to create a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving auction system. IIt highlights **Plonky3**'s strength in generating **complex proof systems** while maintaining efficiency, a critical factor for the large-scale adoption of ZK-based applications.

Additionally, this project serves as a **practical reference** for developers seeking to build **ZK-based decentralized applications (dApps)**, offering a concrete example of how **Plonky3** can be utilized to solve real-world problems. It not only drives innovation within the **Plonky3** ecosystem but also opens up new possibilities for leveraging **ZKPs** in other privacy-critical industries.
