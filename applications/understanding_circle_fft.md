## [Section 1] Project Information

- **Project Name:** Understanding Circle STARKs and Circle FFT through Detailed Examples

- **Payment Details:** 0x850ff718187c15607B939A3fcf11db2B4A0Cc858 (on Polygon Network).

- **Total Amount Requested:** 3,500 USDC

## [Section 2] Project Overview :page_facing_up:

- **Brief Description:**

  This project aims to create a series of four blog articles that provide a comprehensive and accessible introduction to Circle STARKs and Circle FFT. By utilizing detailed examples, diagrams, and Python code based on Mersenne 5, readers will be able to understand the mathematical concepts and practical implementations step by step.

- **Core Idea:**

  I will publish four articles covering:

  1. **Fundamentals of Circle Curves and Group Structures**
     - Introduction to Circle curves and their basic properties
     - Group operations on Circle curves
     - Hands-on examples using Mersenne 5
     - Visual diagrams to enhance intuitive understanding

  2. **Demystifying Circle Domains and Twin Cosets**
     - Explanation of Circle domains
     - Introduction to twin cosets and standard position coset in the context of Circle STARKs
     - Step-by-step examples with Mersenne 5
     - Diagrams illustrating the concepts

  3. **Implementing Circle FFT: A Hands-on Approach**
     - Theoretical background and necessity of Circle FFT
     - Detailed walkthrough of the Circle FFT algorithm
     - Visualization using circle diagrams and butterfly diagrams
     - Python code snippets and hand calculations using Mersenne 5

  4. **Plonky3 Circle FFT Implementation and other topics in Circle STARKs(TBA)**
     - In-depth explanation of Plonky3's Circle FFT code
     - Other interesting or important topics in Circle STATRKs

  Each article will be approximately a 20-minute read.

  **Target Audience and Goals:**

  My goal is to have over 100 people read each article within a few weeks of publishing. Additionally, I aim for at least 40 people to engage with the provided Python code snippets or explore Plonky3's Circle FFT implementation.

  The content will start from the basics and progressively delve into more complex topics, ensuring that readers can build their understanding incrementally. By using small numbers and practical examples, the articles aim to make abstract mathematical concepts tangible.

  The primary goal is to bridge the gap between mathematical theory and practical implementation, making Circle STARKs and Circle FFT accessible and understandable to a broader audience.

- **Target Reader**

  - Developers and enthusiasts with basic knowledge of traditional STARKs and FFT who want to learn about Circle Group operations and Circle FFT.
  - Those looking to understand Plonky3's implementation of Circle FFT.

- **Technology Stack:**

  - [Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3)
  - [Circle STARKs paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/278.pdf)
  - Python

- **Unique Contribution:**

  While existing articles introduce Circle STARKs and Circle FFT, they often lack detailed, understandable examples that allow readers to fully grasp the concepts. This project addresses that gap by providing comprehensive tutorials that combine mathematical explanations with practical examples, diagrams, and Python code. By focusing on Mersenne 5, readers can perform hand calculations and follow along with code snippets, enhancing their understanding.
